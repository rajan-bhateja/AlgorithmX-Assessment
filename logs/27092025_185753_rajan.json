  "answer": "This paper is about **attention mechanisms**, specifically **self-attention** (also called intra-attention) and **Multi-Head Attention**. It describes how self-attention relates different positions of a single sequence to compute a representation and mentions its successful use in tasks such as reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, and anaphora resolution. The paper also discusses how Multi-Head Attention counteracts the effect of averaging attention-weighted positions.\n\nSources used:\n*   \"Figure 3: An example of the attention mechanism following long-distance dependencies in the\"\n*   \"to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2.\"\n*   \"Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence.\"\n*   \"Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\"\n*   \"Figure 4: Two attention heads, also in layer 5 of 6, apparently involved in anaphora resolution.\"",
