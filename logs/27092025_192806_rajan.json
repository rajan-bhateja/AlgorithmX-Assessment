  "answer": "Here is a detailed summary of each section of the paper based on the provided context:\n\n*   **Metric Definitions and Evaluation Notes:** This section defines several metrics used in the paper. It describes an \"N-gram collision\" as having a single collision with any document in the training corpus. \"Relative Difference Clean vs All\" indicates the percentage change in performance between clean examples and all examples. \"Count\" refers to the number of examples, while \"Clean percentage\" is the proportion of clean examples relative to the total. \"Acc/F1/BLEU\" metrics are chosen as specified in \"Metric\". It notes that these scores originate from evaluations using a different random seed for in-context learning examples, leading to slight variations from scores presented elsewhere in the paper.\n    *   **Sources:** First paragraph on page 45.\n\n*   **Appendix D: Total Compute Used to Train Language Models:** This appendix outlines the calculations for approximating the computational resources employed to train the language models referenced in Figure 2.2. A simplifying assumption is made to disregard the attention operation, as it generally accounts for less than 10% of the total compute for the models under analysis. The calculations themselves are found in Table D.1 and are further explained in its caption.\n    *   **Sources:** \"D Total Compute Used to Train Language Models\" header and subsequent paragraphs on page 45.\n\n*   **References/Citations:** This part of the document lists several academic papers. Examples include:\n    *   [DHKH14] Nadir Durrani et al.'s \"Edinburgh’s phrase-based machine translation systems for wmt-14\" from 2014.\n    *   [DL15] Andrew M. Dai and Quoc V. Le's \"Semi-supervised sequence learning\" from 2015.\n    *   [DMST19] Marie-Catherine De Marneffe et al.'s \"The CommitmentBank: Investigating projection in naturally occurring discourse\" from 2019, with data available on GitHub.\n    *   [DSC+16] Yan Duan et al.'s \"Rl2: Fast reinforcement learning via slow reinforcement learning\" from 2016.\n    *   [DWD+19] Dheeru Dua et al.'s paper (title cut off).\n    *   **Sources:** The block of citations/references on page 45.\n\n*   **Footnotes:** Two footnotes are provided:\n    *   Footnote 6 suggests that if a model consistently generates texts more impressive than human articles, human performance on that task could fall below 50%, noting that some individual participants indeed scored below 50%.\n    *   Footnote 7 mentions that additional non-news samples are available in Appendix F.\n    *   **Sources:** Footnotes 6 and 7 on page 26.\n\n*   **Figure 3.13: Human Ability to Identify Model-Generated News Articles:** This figure illustrates that people's capacity to distinguish model-generated news articles decreases as the model size increases. This ability is measured by the ratio of correct assignments to non-neutral assignments. The figure includes a dashed line at the top indicating the accuracy on a deliberately-bad control model (an unconditioned GPT-3 Small model with higher output randomness) and another dashed line at the bottom representing random chance (50%). The line of best fit is a power law, presented with 95% confidence intervals.\n    *   **Sources:** Figure 3.13 and its caption on page 27.\n\n*   **Table 3.12: Human Detection Accuracy of Model-Generated Articles:** This table presents human performance in identifying whether approximately 500-word articles are model-generated. It shows that the correct assignment ratio for the control model was 88%, dropping to 52% for the GPT-3 175B model. The table details mean accuracy, 95% confidence intervals, t-values (p-values) comparing to control, and the percentage of \"I don’t know\" assignments for both the Control and GPT-3 175B models. For instance, the Control model had an 88% accuracy (84-91% CI) with 2.7% \"I don't know\" assignments, while GPT-3 175B had 52% accuracy (48-57% CI) with a t-value of 12.7 (p-value 3.2e-23) and 10.6% \"I don't know\" assignments. It also explains that these are results from a two-sample T-Test comparing GPT-3 175B to the control model (an unconditional GPT-3 Small model with increased output randomness).\n    *   **Sources:** Table 3.12 and its caption on page 27.\n\n*   **Sample Article: \"United Methodists Agree to Historic Split\":** This section provides an example of a news article. The title is \"United Methodists Agree to Historic Split,\" and the subtitle is \"Those who oppose gay marriage will form their own denomination.\" The article text details that after two days of debate, the United Methodist Church agreed to a historic split, expected to result in a new \"theologically and socially conservative\" denomination, based on a majority vote by delegates at the church's annual General Conference in May.\n    *   **Sources:** The \"Title:\", \"Subtitle:\", and \"Article:\" text spanning page 27 and 46.\n\n*   **Appendix E: Participant Details and Article Lengths:** This appendix details participant information and article lengths from experiments evaluating human detection of approximately 200-word model-generated news articles. Participants were excluded if they failed internet checks. Figure E.1, described here, indicates that participants spend more time attempting to identify machine-generated articles as the model size increases. The duration for the control model is shown as a dashed line, and the line of best fit is a linear model on a log (the description is cut off).\n    *   **Sources:** Figure E.1 and its caption, and \"Appendix E\" header on page 46.\n\n*   **Table E.1: Participant and Article Length Data for Detection Experiments:** This table presents detailed information about participants and the average word counts of human- and model-generated articles used in the experiments. It lists various GPT-3 models (Control, Small, Medium, Large, XL, 2.7B, 6.7B, 13.0B, 175B) and, for each, the number of participants recruited, participants excluded, gender distribution (male:female:other), mean age, and average word count for human and model articles. For example, for the Control model, 76 participants were recruited, 7 excluded, with a gender ratio of 32:37:0, a mean age of 39, and an average word count of 216 for both human and model articles. For GPT-3 175B, 80 participants were recruited, 9 excluded, with a gender ratio of 42:29:0, a mean age of 37, and an average word count of 216 for both human and model articles.\n    *   **Sources:** Table E.1 and its caption on page 46.",
